**The Story:** "I spent 10+ years mastering the art of understanding what businesses really need - through recruitment, operations, and business development. Now I'm applying that same strategic thinking to AI, creating systems that solve real business problems instead of just impressive demos."

## The "Career Shift" Positioning

**Instead of:** "I'm new to AI but learning fast"
**Say:** "I spent 10 years understanding what businesses really need. Now I'm building AI systems that deliver exactly that - strategic insights that drive real business decisions."

**The advantage:** Most AI people don't understand business. Most business people don't understand AI. You're the rare person who deeply understands both.

## Next Steps

1. **Validate the interactive components work perfectly**
2. **Create business-focused prompts** for the chat interface
3. **Ensure the CRM can answer strategic business questions**
4. **Build a narrative that positions your background as the perfect preparation for this role**

Your background isn't a weakness - it's your secret weapon. Malte needs someone who can think like a consultant and build like an engineer. That's exactly what you are.
