AnythingLLM Embedded Chat Widget
This is a submodule of AnythingLLM - the all-in-one AI Application

Please report any issues or feature requests to the main repo

Warning

The core AnythingLLM team publishes a pre-built version of the script that is bundled with the main application. You can find it in the main repo here. You should only be working in this repo if you are wanting to build your own custom embed widget for AnythingLLM

This folder of AnythingLLM contains the source code for how the embedded version of AnythingLLM works to provide a public facing interface of your workspace.

The AnythingLLM Embedded chat widget allows you to expose a workspace and its embedded knowledge base as a chat bubble via a <script> or <iframe> element that you can embed in a website or HTML.

Security
Users will not be able to view or read context snippets like they can in the core AnythingLLM application
Users are assigned a random session ID that they use to persist a chat session.
Recommended You can limit both the number of chats an embedding can process and per-session.
by using the AnythingLLM embedded chat widget you are responsible for securing and configuration of the embed as to not allow excessive chat model abuse of your instance

Developer Setup
cd embed from the root of the repo
yarn to install all dev and script dependencies
yarn dev to boot up an example HTML page to use the chat embed widget.
While in development mode (yarn dev) the script will rebuild on any changes to files in the src directory. Ensure that the required keys for the development embed are accurate and set.

yarn build will compile and minify your build of the script. You can then host and link your built script wherever you like.
